    <p>Most plant and animal cells are only visible under a light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 <i>micrometres</i>. Electron microscopy gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure. Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria) or multicellular (including plants and animals).</p>

    <p>Most unicellular organisms are classed as microorganisms. The number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species; it has been estimated that the human body contains around 37 trillion (3.72Ã—1013) cells. The human brain accounts for around 80 billion of these cells.</p>
